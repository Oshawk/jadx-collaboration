## JADX Collaboration

A plugin to enable users to collaborate on a JADX-GUI project.

## Installation

This plugin currently requires a development version of JADX. Either [build from source](https://github.com/skylot/jadx?tab=readme-ov-file#build-from-source) or use the following steps.

- Navigate [here](https://github.com/skylot/jadx/actions/workflows/build-artifacts.yml).
- Select the latest run.
- Download a build artefact (seems to require sign-in).

In JADX-GUI:

- Navigate to `File > Preferences > Plugins`.
- Click `Install plugin`.
- Enter `github:Oshawk:jadx-collaboration` as the `Location id`.
- Click `Install` and `Save`.
- If there is a project open, use `File > Reload files`.
